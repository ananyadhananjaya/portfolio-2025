        ABOUT
      </h4>
      <p>
        I'm a developer who thrives on building accessible, pixel-perfect user
        interfaces that merge design and engineering seamlessly. I enjoy working
        at the intersection of design and development, crafting experiences that
        are both visually stunning and highly performant.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have 4 years of experience as a frontend engineer, specializing in
        React, TypeScript, and modern UI frameworks. At {" "}
        <b className="text-zinc-300">Edstruments</b>, I led scrums, refactored
        core modules, and improved code reusability with Storybook. Previously,
        at <b className="text-zinc-300">Infosys</b>, I worked on a client
        project with a Micro Frontend Architecture, developing reusable
        components and contributing to an NPM package. My work focuses on
        building scalable, high-performance web applications with clean,
        maintainable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, my husband and I love going on hikes and taking long
        walks together, exploring new trails and enjoying the outdoors.
